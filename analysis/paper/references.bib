Based on recent survey data administered to the Society for California Archaeology membership, I consider the demographic makeup of mentors and mentees, a diachronic analysis of mentor and mentee relationships, quantitative and qualitative responses to individual experiences with mentors, and the ways in which gender and race/ethnicity play out in the context of these relationships over time. Results indicate that greater disparities exist in mentoring relationships involving women and racial/ethnic minorities—disparities that have persisted since the founding of North American archaeology and continue to the present day. The cause for these disjunctions may originate from a lack of diversity in potential mentors within academia.}, number={2}, journal={California Archaeology}, publisher={Routledge}, author={Brown, Kaitlin M.}, year={2018}, month={Jul}, pages={187–209} }

We analyzed student career aspirations in combination with student achievement in mathematics, reading, and science, as well as parental occupations and family wealth. In each country and region, more boys than girls aspired to a things-oriented or STEM occupation and more girls than boys to a people-oriented occupation. These sex differences were larger in countries with a higher level of women’s empowerment. We explain this counter-intuitive finding through the indirect effect of wealth. Women’s empowerment is associated with relatively high levels of national wealth and this wealth allows more students to aspire to occupations they are intrinsically interested in. Implications for better understanding the sources of sex differences in career aspirations and associated policy are discussed.}, number={1}, journal={PLOS ONE}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Stoet, Gijsbert and Geary, David C.}, year={2022}, month={Jan}, pages={e0261438} }

 abstract="The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",

First, gender bias in academia affects female scientists, resulting in their underrepresentation in academic institutions, particularly in higher ranks. The second type of gender bias in science relates to some findings applying only to male participants, which produces biased knowledge. Here, we identify a third potentially powerful source of gender bias in academia: the bias against research on gender bias. In a bibliometric investigation covering a broad range of social sciences, we analyzed published articles on gender bias and race bias and established that articles on gender bias are funded less often and published in journals with a lower Impact Factor than articles on comparable instances of social discrimination. This result suggests the possibility of an underappreciation of the phenomenon of gender bias and related research within the academic community. Addressing this meta-bias is crucial for the further examination of gender inequality, which severely affects many women across the world.}, number={1}, journal={Scientometrics}, author={Cislak, Aleksandra and Formanowicz, Magdalena and Saguy, Tamar}, year={2018}, month={Apr}, pages={189–200} }
